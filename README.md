# BastionHost_Project
A project simulating a Bastion host (Jumping server) in AWS using EC2 and VPCs

## üìê Architecture ##
- Two Diferents VPCs (Diferents IPV4 CIDR)
- VPC peering
- Subnets
- ACLs for minimun traffic 
- EC2 machines 
- Security Groupes


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Services ##
- AWS EC2
- AWS VPC
- VPC Peering
- ACLs and Security Groups


## üîß Starting ##
- We will start by doing all the configuration of VPC_1, and after it, we create the VPC_2 and configurate for communication
- Create Two diferents VPCs (VPC_1 and VPC_2 both with diferents CIDR);
  - VPC_1:
    - Create Three Subnets: SubNet_A, SubNet_B, SubNet_C
    - Create an ACL for each Subnet (Open the Document ACL_Subnets_beggining.md to see more about the begging configuration)
    - Create EC2 instances (Open the Document EC2_Instances.md, to see more about it)
    - Create Security Groupes (Open the Document Sg.md, to see more about the configuration)
